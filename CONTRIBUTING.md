# Contributor guidelines - CSSLint

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

# Contributor License Agreement

A CLA is a document that specifies how a project is allowed to use your code. We've put a lot of work into creating a CLA that is simple, effective, and as clear as possible so that it doesn't disrupt contributions to CSS Lint.

When you make a contribution to the CSS Lint project, you agree:

* The code you wrote is your original work (you own the copyright) or you otherwise have the right to submit the work.
* To grant the CSS Lint project a nonexclusive, irrevocable license to use your submitted code in any way.
* You are capable of granting these rights for the contribution.

By submitting a fix to CSS Lint you agree to the above statements.

# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to
fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing
this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of
Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting a project maintainer at nicole AT stubbornella DOT org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident.
